Below we have listed all forms of data that we collect from users:

### Message Content Storage
While in-game (which you choose wether to participate or not), your messages are read by us once to determine your target, and is forgotten and deleted immediately afterwards.

### Server Members
While in-game (your decision to take part), your surface user info (name, discriminator, ID) are stored for our player tracking system. After the game ends, all member-related data is erased from our systems.

### Data Deletion
No member-related data nor message content data is persistently stored. If you wish to remove your server's game configurations, you can invoke the `bansettings clear` command on the bot. Kicking the bot will remove any remaining data we have on your server.
